This smart Google Assistant project is worked based on aiyprojects-raspbian by dimitriykovalev on github
The original project: https://github.com/google/aiyprojects-raspbian

Our customised system for Assignment 2 - Smart Office Application is an office
automation project to automate the medical appointments process known as MAPS (medical
appointment system). 

With the implementation of Google Assistant, we managed to create a smart IoT application that can process functionalities in a more convinient way.
